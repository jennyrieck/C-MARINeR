C-MARINeR
=========

C-MARINeR is a focused sub-project MARINeR: *M*ultivariate *A*nalysis and *R*esampling *I*nference for *Ne*uroimaging in *R*. The "C" stands generally for connectivity, but specifically (and statistically) covariance or correlation. C-MARINeR was also initially planned as a third phase (A, B, C) in MARINeR that addresses one table (A), two table (B), and multi-table (C) analyses for neuroimaging data.

At its core, the C-MARINeR project uses a particular statistical technique called STATIS. STATIS is an acronym in French that roughly translates to “structuring three way statistical tables”.

General outline and goals
=========================

This project has been underway through separate works on connectivity by the repo maintainers (Jenny & Derek). We are bringing these projects together under a single project now, with milestones that align with BrainHackTO:2019 and OHBM's BrainHack in Rome. We will provide status updates, project progress, and ultimately a fully functional ShinyApp with examples going forward.
